/** A trick based off [[cats.NotNull]], exploiting the Scala's requirement that if there's a matching implicit value in
  * the scope, there should be EXACTLY ONE - in case there's two or more matching implicit values, a compilation error
  * is raised.
  *
  * To statically ensure that the given type A is NOT `Future`, request an implicit instance of `NotFuture[A]`, e.g.
  * `class AllTypesButFutureWelcome[A: NotFuture]`. There will be: <li> exactly one instance of `NotFuture[A]` if `A !=
  * Future`, <li> exactly TWO instances of `NotFuture[A]` if `A == Future`, leading to a compilation error.

      * `anotherMethodReturningEitherT` will NOT wait for `someMethodReturningFuture` to complete. <br/> The likely
      * intention of the developer was to use [[EitherT.liftF]] rather than [[EitherT.rightT]] or [[EitherT.pure]].
      * <br/> Note that there's no compiler warning, even when `-Ywarn-discarded-value` is enabled.
      *
      * This can lead to very subtle, hard to spot race conditions that might be never captured by any test, and e.g.
      * only manifest itself under the specific conditions of production environment. <br/> To prevent these bugs, we
      * explicitly forbid calling either `rightT` or `pure` via ArchUnit spec, and instead provide this `safeRightT`
      * method, which thanks to [[NotFuture]] context bound will never allow for mistakenly wrapping a `Future`, but
      * will instead raise an error and point the developer to `EitherT.liftF`.
